Destructure and at the same time rename variables using ES6 syntax is another one of those handy tricks I can't remember the syntax.

Let's consider this example:

```javascript
// Coordinates of Portland, Oregon
const longitude = -122.676483
const latitude = 45.523064

// Here you can't destructure longitude and latitude 
// from the response object because the same variables
// already exist
const {longitude, latitude} = response.data
```

Fortunately, you can rename variables on the fly as you destructure them by simply declaring the new name following a colon, like this:

*const {actual_name : new_name} =  props*


To fix duplicate variables error in our previous example:
```
...
// currentLng and currentLat are your new variables
const {longitude: currentLng, latitude: currentLat} = response.data
```
