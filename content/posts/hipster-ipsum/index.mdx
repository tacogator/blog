Every now and then whenever I need to align a button or a div in the center of a container I can't seem to remember how to do it.

**Option 1:  The old school way**

```css
.center {
    margin: 0 auto;
    width: 250px;
}
```
Caveat:  *In order for this method to work, the div you want to center must have the `width` property.*

**Option 2: The flexbox method**

```
.parent {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center; /* horizontal alignment */
  align-items: center;     /* vertical */
  background: LightSteelBlue;
  height: 50px;
}

<div class="parent">
  <div>
    <button>I &hearts; taco</button>
    <button>Cancel</button>
  </div>
</div>
```
