Hi, I'm a former-corporate-backend-developer-turned-indie-entrepreneur.

I build web apps with Javascript, Python, Pandas and deploy them on Linux/Kubernetes.

On this blog, I'm sharing with you short tech notes of things I personally found counterintuitive and hard to remember.

You can reach me by [email](mailto:nachoserrano@lavabit.com) and follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/nacho_codes).
